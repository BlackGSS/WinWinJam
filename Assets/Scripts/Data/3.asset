  textWinEng: I regret nothing. I can say I've lived my life to the fullest. There
    were always hard times and shit happened, but it was absolutely worth it. Of
    course you can't see that while you are on the road, cause, you know, you don't
    actually know where you are going, specially if the road is unknown. I took my
    chances, and I was absolutely terrified, but I decided to walk that path and
    I am proud of it. I love the view from here.
